Build a 4-bit shift register (right shift), with asynchronous positive edge triggered areset, synchronous active high signals load, and enable. 
// (1) areset: Resets shift register to zero. 
// (2) load: Loads shift register with data[3:0] instead of shifting. 
// (3) ena: Shift right (q[3] becomes zero, q[0] is shifted out and disappears). 
// (4) q: The contents of the shift register. If both the load and ena inputs are asserted (1), the load input has higher priority.
